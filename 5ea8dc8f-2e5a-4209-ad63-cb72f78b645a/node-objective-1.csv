"Main objective","Objective","OBJ1","6070d3ab-15d2-4909-b7ec-6425e85346a2","","To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 erroralpha=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]).","Objective_1"
"Safety","Objective","OBJ2","b6ad106a-2320-4d24-9f4f-17fd75fbb464","","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.","Objective_2"
"Behaviour","Objective","OBJ3","1cc8630c-f53e-485f-9657-05b218712681","","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas.","Objective_3"
"","Objective","OBJ4","afb4f0f2-015b-45a7-98ea-0c433ec9116f","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in activities of daily living. Improved scores on the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) will indicate improvement in these areas (see Attachment LZZT.5).","Objective_4"
"","Objective","OBJ5","0bfda850-1920-49ac-9b1d-1a4c830452e3","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in an extended assessment of cognition that integrates attention/concentration tasks. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-14 item Cognitive Subscale, hereafter referred to as ADAS-Cog (14), will be used for this assessment (see Attachment LZZT.2).","Objective_5"
