"Safety","Objective","OBJ2","24dbaaa3-4434-4aa9-b1ab-6d130ff874f7","","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.","Objective_2"
"Behaviour","Objective","OBJ3","90e28b8e-bb0f-47f1-965f-cd6c343737fd","","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
