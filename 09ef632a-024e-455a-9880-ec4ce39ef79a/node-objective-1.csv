"OBJ1","","Main objective","To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 erroralpha=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]).","Objective_1","Objective","f72ef6c3-6ddc-4742-aec6-c80f20d33a39"
"OBJ2","","Safety","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS.","Objective_2","Objective","f1c5b363-eded-42cb-8913-92e509d27eb5"
"OBJ3","","Behaviour","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas.","Objective_3","Objective","e8567ce5-aea7-4931-9838-36626058b5de"

"OBJ5","","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in an extended assessment of cognition that integrates attention/concentration tasks. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-14 item Cognitive Subscale, hereafter referred to as ADAS-Cog (14), will be used for this assessment (see Attachment LZZT.2).","Objective_5","Objective","a4f8492b-bdb1-43c8-8023-d7100196beb3"
"OBJ6","","","To assess the treatment response as a function of Apo E genotype.","Objective_6","Objective","9d8aa143-61d6-42d2-98fe-ef819fc62854"
