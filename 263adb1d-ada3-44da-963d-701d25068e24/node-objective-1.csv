"Main objective","Objective_1","OBJ1","Objective","2e811a93-a0d5-4463-82d6-d4215a57c706","","To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 erroralpha=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg])."
"Safety","Objective_2","OBJ2","Objective","9f27eeee-d389-4627-b0b2-75668e114b56","","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS."
"Behaviour","Objective_3","OBJ3","Objective","ac96e283-a7ae-4d11-95a4-e78923ebd5eb","","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas."
"","Objective_4","OBJ4","Objective","8e855755-c0fc-48f0-88f2-d8cdc86636c0","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in activities of daily living. Improved scores on the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) will indicate improvement in these areas (see Attachment LZZT.5)."
"","Objective_5","OBJ5","Objective","6ff8e970-5981-4678-a79f-48bba1d6e43d","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in an extended assessment of cognition that integrates attention/concentration tasks. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-14 item Cognitive Subscale, hereafter referred to as ADAS-Cog (14), will be used for this assessment (see Attachment LZZT.2)."
"","Objective_6","OBJ6","Objective","b2d4ec8b-8fef-401a-9606-3f9b752c3b18","","To assess the treatment response as a function of Apo E genotype."
