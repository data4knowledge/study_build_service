"Main objective","Objective_1","OBJ1","Objective","7e326cdd-0298-4f6a-812e-a1d5635891ed","","To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 erroralpha=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg])."
"Safety","Objective_2","OBJ2","Objective","0481d87b-5504-4b5b-8056-536efcb9f1f7","","To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS."
"Behaviour","Objective_3","OBJ3","Objective","55052883-ba59-45e1-8bd0-d72a82ea3899","","To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these
areas."
"","Objective_4","OBJ4","Objective","7647c863-a559-4907-b465-8031f4fea1b6","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in activities of daily living. Improved scores on the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) will indicate improvement in these areas (see Attachment LZZT.5)."
"","Objective_5","OBJ5","Objective","f2b0a317-63b7-450e-a20c-28fa97f3dd33","","To assess the dose-dependent improvements in an extended assessment of cognition that integrates attention/concentration tasks. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-14 item Cognitive Subscale, hereafter referred to as ADAS-Cog (14), will be used for this assessment (see Attachment LZZT.2)."
